The purpose of this project is to create a simple mobile application while apprehending the new Apple Swift language. This app will be an adaptation of JavaScript project [TodoMVC](http://todomvc.com/) and will try to respect as much as possible the [specification](https://github.com/tastejs/todomvc/blob/master/app-spec.md).

This app will then be a good basis for experimenting new iOS features and Swift.

The full project is available in the ```Code``` folder.

## What's in there?

- Swift 3.2 code
- App Group to share data between the main app and the extension(s)
- Dynamic Framework to limit code repetition and share code between the main app and the extension(s), mainly the Core Data Stack with the models
- Today Extension
